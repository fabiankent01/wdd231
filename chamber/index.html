                     EDUCATION AND TRAINING (TVET) VISITS BENIN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL</h3>      
                <p class="blogtext">
                    On Tuesday, April 23rd, 2024, an anticipated meeting is scheduled between The President, Hon. 
                    (Barr.) Austin Atakpu, and select Council members, who are set to host Dr. Terseer Nyulaku, the Executive Secretary 
                    of the Board of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET), along with his team. 
                    The venue for this engagement is the President's office located in GRA, Benin City.<br><br>
                    
                    The formalities will commence with introductions from both sides. Dr. Nyulaku will highlight that the involvement of private sector entities is crucial not 
                    only due to their status as employers but also because of their integral position as social partners in the TVET ecosystem.<br><br>
                    
                    During the discourse, Dr. Terseer Nyulaku will express the intention of his team to seek partnership with BENCCIMA, 
                    particularly in light of the forthcoming launch of the Edo State Technical Talent Development Policy. He will assure the 
                    Chamber of their commitment to collaboration by promising to forward the draft policy document for their valuable input 
                    and feedback.<br><br>
